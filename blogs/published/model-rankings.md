## Author Note

This blog post is intentionally left as a shell for you to fill with your personal experiences, model assessments, and evolving perspectives on AI capabilities.

Unlike the other blogs which provide structured research and analysis, this one should be **purely your voice** - subjective, opinionated, and grounded in your real-world experience with different models.

## Suggested Structure

### Opening: Why Rankings Are Both Useful and Misleading

[YOUR VOICE: Set up the tension - rankings help people make decisions, but they're also oversimplifications that miss context]

Possible themes:
- Rankings change monthly as models evolve
- "Best" depends entirely on use case
- Your preferences have evolved over time as you've learned what matters

### Section 1: The Models You've Used

[YOUR EXPERIENCE: Walk through your journey with different models]

Suggested coverage:
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Your assessment, what it excels at, where it falls short
- **GPT-4/GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)** - Same treatment
- **Gemini (Google)** - If you've used it extensively
- **Open-source models** - Llama, Mistral, etc. - if relevant to your experience
- **Others** - Any niche or specialized models you've evaluated

For each, consider:
- First impressions vs. long-term use
- Specific use cases where it shines
- Deal-breakers or limitations
- How it compares to alternatives
- Whether you'd recommend it (and to whom)

### Section 2: The Dimensions That Actually Matter

[YOUR FRAMEWORK: What criteria do you use to evaluate models?]

Possible dimensions:
- **Reasoning capability** - Can it think through complex problems?
- **Context window** - How much information can it handle?
- **Coding ability** - Specific to your use cases
- **Writing quality** - Voice, tone, nuance
- **Instruction following** - Does it do what you ask?
- **Creativity vs. accuracy** - The tradeoff
- **Speed** - Response time matters for some workflows
- **Cost** - ROI for different use cases
- **Reliability** - Consistency across requests
- **Multimodal capabilities** - Vision, audio, etc.

Not all dimensions matter equally. Which ones do you prioritize and why?

### Section 3: How Your Rankings Have Changed

[YOUR EVOLUTION: How has your assessment shifted over time?]

Possible themes:
- Models you initially loved but grew frustrated with
- Models you initially dismissed but came to appreciate
- What changed (the models improved, or you learned to use them better, or your needs evolved)
- Moments where a model surprised you (positively or negatively)

### Section 4: The Use-Case Specificity Problem

[YOUR INSIGHT: Why "best model" is the wrong question]

Explore:
- Different models for different jobs
- Why you might use multiple models in a single workflow
- The danger of one-size-fits-all thinking
- How organizational needs differ from individual needs

### Section 5: Current Rankings (With Caveats)

[YOUR RANKINGS: As of [date], here's how you'd rank models for specific use cases]

Suggested format:

**For long-form writing:**
1. [Your pick]
2. [Second choice]
3. [Third choice]

Reasoning: [Why]

**For coding:**
1. [Your pick]
2. [Second choice]
3. [Third choice]

Reasoning: [Why]

**For research and analysis:**
[Same treatment]

**For creative brainstorming:**
[Same treatment]

**For general-purpose use:**
[Same treatment]

**Important:** Date-stamp these rankings and note they'll be outdated soon.

### Section 6: What's Coming (Speculation)

[YOUR PREDICTIONS: Where do you think model capabilities are headed?]

Possible themes:
- Convergence (all models becoming roughly equivalent)
- Divergence (specialization increasing)
- Diminishing returns (are we hitting capability plateaus?)
- Surprising developments on the horizon
- What you hope changes vs. what you expect will change

### Closing: The Meta-Lesson

[YOUR TAKEAWAY: What should readers learn from this?]

Possible themes:
- Don't over-index on rankings - experiment yourself
- Context and fit matter more than benchmark scores
- Your mileage will vary based on your use cases
- Stay flexible as the landscape evolves
- Focus on building skills that transfer across models

## Tone and Voice Guidance

This blog should be:
- **Personal** - "I've found that..." not "Research shows that..."
- **Opinionated** - Take strong positions, acknowledge they're subjective
- **Evolving** - Show your thinking has changed, will change again
- **Humble** - You're sharing experience, not declaring absolute truth
- **Practical** - Grounded in real use cases, not abstract capabilities

Avoid:
- Overly diplomatic hedging ("some might say..." - just say what **you** think)
- Benchmark worship (scores matter less than actual performance in your workflows)
- Treating rankings as permanent (they're snapshots that age quickly)
- Pretending objectivity (this is explicitly subjective)

---

## Research Considerations

Unlike other blogs, this one shouldn't have [RESEARCH: ...] placeholders.

It should be **pure experience and opinion** - your assessments based on actual use.

However, you might want to:
- Reference specific model releases or updates that changed your view
- Note when your assessment differs from popular opinion (and why)
- Acknowledge where you have limited experience (e.g., "I haven't used Gemini extensively enough to assess...")

## Connection to Other Blogs

**Light linkage, don't overdo it:**

- [Claude Code](/blog/claude-code-agentic-tool) - When discussing coding capabilities
- [Multi-Cloud in the AI Era](/blog/cloud-provider-diversification) - When discussing using multiple models strategically
- [Custom Chat Interfaces](/blog/custom-chat-interfaces) - When discussing how interface affects model perception

But this blog should stand alone as a personal perspective piece.

## Final Note

This is your space to be opinionated, subjective, and personal in a way the other blogs aren't.

The other 13 blogs are research-backed, structured, educational.

This one is: "Here's what I think, based on actually using these tools. Your experience may differ. That's the point."

Make it yours.
