## The Draft

On September 12, 2025, the EU Data Act takes full effect. Most executives think it's a compliance checkbox. A few paragraphs for the legal team, maybe some API documentation updates.

They're wrong.

The Data Act is a forcing function that rewrites the economics of SaaS vendor lock-in. And the vendors who understand this—who lean into data portability instead of fighting it—will dominate the next decade.

Here's what changes: The EU Data Act mandates that SaaS companies provide **machine-readable data export** and **active support for switching to competitors**. Not performative CSV dumps that lose metadata. Not rate-limited APIs that make bulk export impractical. Real, comprehensive, usable data portability.

For vendors who built moats on proprietary formats and data gravity, this is an existential threat.

For vendors who embrace data freedom as competitive advantage, this is the opportunity.

[Siloed Information: How SAAS Companies Protect Their Moat](/blog/siloed-information-saas-moat) explained why vendors trap data. [The SAAS Reckoning: Evolution in the AI Era](/blog/saas-evolution-ai-era) explained why that strategy is dying. This post is about what replaces it—and what you should do about it.

## The Old Moat Strategy: Data Lock-In as Business Model

Let's be clear about how this worked.

SaaS vendors didn't accidentally make data portability difficult. It was the strategy.

**The Classic Playbook:**

**1. Proprietary Export Formats**

You can export your data. Technically. But it comes in a vendor-specific format that loses relationships between records, drops custom fields, strips metadata, and generally makes migration to a competitor somewhere between "extremely painful" and "effectively impossible."

Salesforce's Data Export Service performs full exports only—never incremental. You get weekly or monthly schedules, not on-demand. And the format? Good luck preserving all those custom objects and relationships when you try to import into a competitor.

**2. API Rate Limits That Prevent Real Portability**

They advertise "robust APIs" for integration. What they don't advertise: the rate limits that make bulk data extraction impractically slow.

Professional Salesforce users get 1,000 API calls per user per 24 hours. Need to analyze your full customer database? Hope you've got weeks to wait.

Slack's 2024 API changes explicitly prohibited bulk data export. Twitter limits exports to 1.5 million tweets per month—and those exports only include tweet IDs, not content. You have to "rehydrate" them through additional API calls.

The pattern is consistent: provide an API to claim openness, impose restrictions that make real portability impractical.

**3. Data Gravity Through Network Effects**

Once your data lives in their system, and your workflows depend on it, and your employees are trained on it, and your integrations are built around it, switching becomes prohibitively expensive.

The numbers prove it: **Three documented SaaS provider migrations in 2025 each took 3-4 weeks of developer time and cost over $40,000 in developer hours.** And these were relatively straightforward migrations—not complex enterprise deployments with custom integrations.

The switching costs include:
- Prompt re-optimization for different systems
- Employee retraining across the organization
- Integration rebuilding
- Testing and validation
- Risk of data loss in transit

Most organizations look at that cost and decide to stay. Even when better alternatives exist. Even when pricing increases.

That's the moat. And for 20 years, it worked brilliantly.

## Why the EU Data Act Changes Everything

The Data Act doesn't just require data export. It requires **continuous, real-time, machine-readable data portability** for business users.

**Article 6: Right to Access and Use Data**

Organizations have the right to access data generated by their use of connected products and services. Not just their input data—all derived data, analytics, behavioral patterns, everything the vendor's system generates.

**Article 5: Switching Between Data Processing Services**

This is the nuclear option: vendors must provide "effective technical and organizational measures to facilitate the switching of the data user to another data processing service." That means **actively helping customers move to competitors.**

Not grudging compliance. Active facilitation.

**The Timeline:**

- **September 12, 2025**: Full enforcement begins
- **2025-2026**: Transition period where vendors must demonstrate compliance
- **2027 onward**: Penalties for non-compliance can reach 4% of global annual turnover (GDPR-style enforcement)

The European Commission isn't messing around. They watched GDPR enforcement generate €4.5 billion in fines through 2024. The Data Act uses the same enforcement framework.

## The Counterintuitive Truth: Data Freedom Is Competitive Advantage

Here's where most vendors get it wrong.

They think: "If customers can leave easily, they will leave."

The reality: **When customers know they can leave, they choose to stay.**

This isn't theory. It's proven in multiple markets.

**The Psychology:**

Customers trapped by lock-in resent their vendors. They're actively looking for alternatives. They talk to competitors. They build internal solutions to reduce dependency. They negotiate aggressively and give minimal commitment.

Customers who choose to stay because the product is genuinely best-in-class become advocates. They expand usage. They provide feedback. They renew enthusiastically.

Which customer relationship is more valuable?

**The Economics:**

Vendors competing on lock-in face a permanent retention problem. They need increasingly aggressive sales tactics to prevent churn. They spend on retention instead of innovation.

Vendors competing on value invest in making their product indispensable through quality, not friction. Customer lifetime value increases. Acquisition costs decrease because customers refer others.

**The Strategic Insight:**

In a market where AI makes custom development increasingly viable ([Claude Code: The Agentic Tool Everyone is Sleeping On](/blog/claude-code-agentic-tool)), the build-vs-buy calculation shifts constantly.

Organizations trapped in mediocre SaaS platforms increasingly choose build. Organizations that love their SaaS vendors choose to keep buying—even when building is technically feasible.

Data freedom signals: "We're confident our product is the best option. We don't need to trap you."

That confidence attracts customers.

## MCPs: The Technical Infrastructure for Data Portability

[Model Context Protocols: The Connectors That Enable Everything](/blog/model-context-protocols) covers MCPs in depth, but here's why they matter for Data Act compliance.

**The Problem MCPs Solve:**

Traditional integrations require custom code for each vendor pair. Salesforce → HubSpot requires one integration. Salesforce → Pipedrive requires a different integration. Scaling this across the SaaS ecosystem creates exponential complexity.

MCPs provide a standard protocol—like USB ports for data access. Build an MCP server once, any compatible system can connect.

**The Architecture:**

MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, HTTP, or WebSocket transports. The protocol defines:
- Standardized discovery (what capabilities does this server expose?)
- Consistent authentication (OAuth 2.1 support as of March 2025)
- Structured data formats (JSON Schema definitions)
- Built-in streaming for large datasets

**Why This Enables Data Act Compliance:**

Instead of building custom export tools for every possible competitor, SaaS vendors can expose MCP servers that any system can query.

A customer wants to evaluate a competitor? They grant the competitor's system access to their existing vendor's MCP server. The competitor pulls data directly, in real-time, with full fidelity.

No custom integration. No manual CSV export and import. No data loss. No weeks of developer time.

**The Adoption Numbers:**

- **16,000+ MCP servers** deployed across organizations by April 2025
- **8 million+ downloads** of MCP implementations
- **Major vendor support**: OpenAI (March 2025), Google (April 2025), Microsoft (May 2025)

This isn't a theoretical standard. It's production infrastructure, scaling rapidly.

**Real-World Impact:**

Block's engineering team integrated MCP-based development tools and reported **50-75% time savings** on routine tasks like code review, documentation lookup, and debugging. These tools are now used by thousands of engineers daily.

When a standard can demonstrate that level of efficiency gain, adoption accelerates. And when adoption reaches critical mass, it becomes infrastructure—not a choice, but a requirement.

## Impact on Vendor Strategy: Four Fundamental Shifts

The Data Act forces SaaS vendors to make strategic choices they've avoided for 20 years.

### Shift 1: From Seat-Based to Usage-Based Pricing

When customers can leave easily, charging for "seats" makes no sense. You need to charge for value delivered, not access granted.

**The Data:**

67% of SaaS companies now use usage or consumption-based pricing, up from 52% in 2022. Meanwhile, traditional seat-based pricing dropped from 21% to 15% in just 12 months.

More telling: Companies maintaining seat-based pricing for AI products see **40% lower gross margins** and **2.3 times higher churn** than those adopting usage or outcome-based models.

**Why Usage-Based Pricing Works Better:**

- Revenue scales with customer success (alignment of incentives)
- Customers can start small and expand naturally (lower barriers to entry)
- Overuse becomes a revenue opportunity, not a cost center
- Customers perceive fair pricing (pay for what you use)

**Examples Done Right:**

- **Stripe**: Percentage + fixed amount per successful payment API call
- **Twilio**: Pay-as-you-go, volume discounts, and committed-use discounts for communications APIs
- **Snowflake**: Charges for processing power by seconds of query usage plus compressed data storage
- **OpenAI**: Per-token pricing, transparent and directly tied to value

These companies don't trap customers with seat licenses. They compete on API quality, reliability, and value.

### Shift 2: From Walled Gardens to Ecosystem Platforms

The vendors that win enable their customers to build on top of them—even if that means customers could leave.

**Strategic Calculation:**

**Option A (Old Model)**: Build a walled garden. Limited integrations. Proprietary formats. Hope customers get too embedded to leave.

**Option B (New Model)**: Build a platform. Rich APIs. Open standards. Compete on being the best foundation for customer workflows.

Option B sounds risky. It's actually safer.

Why? Because in a world where customers can leave, the vendors that become infrastructure—that other systems are built on top of—create switching costs through genuine value, not artificial friction.

**Case Study: HubSpot**

HubSpot was the first major CRM to ship a production-grade MCP integration in June 2025. Their "deep research" connector allows AI systems to perform natural language queries with live HubSpot data.

Critically, they built for **open interoperability** with a wide range of AI models—not just one vendor's ecosystem.

The result? HubSpot positioned themselves as the CRM for organizations building AI-native workflows. Competitors without MCP support fell behind.

### Shift 3: From API as Afterthought to API-First Architecture

Most SaaS products are "web app with an API bolted on." That model dies under the Data Act.

**What API-First Actually Means:**

- Your own web interface uses the exact same API that customers use
- No "internal APIs" with more capabilities than public ones
- API documentation is first-class, not buried in support docs
- API performance is a product metric, not an infrastructure concern

**Why This Works:**

When your product relies on the same API you expose to customers, you're forced to make that API excellent. Because if it's slow, limited, or poorly documented, you feel the pain directly.

And when the Data Act requires comprehensive data access? You're already compliant. Because your product already depends on that access layer.

### Shift 4: From Data Lock-In to Intelligence Lock-In

The new moat isn't "we have your data." It's "we make your data more valuable."

**The Strategic Question:**

If customers can easily port their data to competitors, why would they stay with you?

**The Answer:**

Because your system does something with that data that competitors can't match.

- Better AI-powered insights from domain-specific models
- Superior data quality (de-duplication, enrichment, validation)
- Unique integrations that create compound value
- Network effects (industry benchmarks, community data)
- Proprietary algorithms that genuinely work better

Notice what's missing from that list: "because switching is too painful."

The vendors that build moats through genuine intelligence—not artificial friction—thrive in a world of mandatory data portability.

## What Buyers Should Do: Audit and Prioritize

If you're on the customer side—CTO, VP Engineering, enterprise architect—the Data Act creates leverage you haven't had in 20 years.

Use it.

### Action 1: Audit Your Current Tech Stack for Lock-In Risk

**Questions to ask about each SaaS vendor:**

1. Can we export all our data in a standard, machine-readable format? (Not just some data. All of it.)
2. Does the export include metadata, relationships, and derived data?
3. Can we perform bulk data access without hitting rate limits?
4. Do they support industry-standard APIs (REST, GraphQL) or proprietary protocols?
5. Have they announced MCP support or equivalent interoperability standards?
6. What would it actually cost to switch to a competitor? (Developer time, migration risk, business disruption)

**Risk Categories:**

- **High Lock-In Risk**: Proprietary formats, limited APIs, no MCP support, vendor claims "migration is not supported"
- **Medium Lock-In Risk**: Standard formats but complex data models, APIs with rate limits, migration "possible but not recommended"
- **Low Lock-In Risk**: Open standards, comprehensive APIs, MCP support, vendor actively facilitates switching

Vendors in the "high risk" category are exposed to Data Act enforcement. They'll either comply (improving your position) or face penalties (creating instability).

### Action 2: Prioritize Vendors That Enable Data Freedom

When evaluating new SaaS tools, make data portability a first-order requirement.

**The New RFP Section:**

Instead of "Do you provide an API?" ask:

- What is your Data Act compliance strategy?
- Do you support MCP or equivalent open standards?
- Can we test a full data export before committing?
- What technical support do you provide for customers switching to competitors?
- What is your roadmap for data portability features?

Vendors that hesitate or provide vague answers are telling you their strategy is lock-in. Walk away.

Vendors that enthusiastically demonstrate portability are signaling confidence in their product quality. Those are strategic partners worth building on.

### Action 3: Build Internal Data Infrastructure

Don't let your canonical data live exclusively in SaaS platforms.

[The Data Storage Reality](/blog/data-storage-reality) discusses costs, but here's the strategic imperative:

**Build a Central Data Warehouse You Control**

- Sync data from SaaS platforms into your own data lake
- Use ETL tools to normalize and consolidate data
- Make the data lake your source of truth for analytics and AI
- SaaS platforms become operational systems, not strategic data repositories

**Why This Matters:**

Even if vendors comply with the Data Act, relying entirely on their systems for data access creates dependency. Your AI systems, analytics, decision-making—all dependent on their API availability and pricing.

By maintaining your own data infrastructure:
- You control access patterns and costs
- You can consolidate data across multiple SaaS platforms
- You're positioned to switch vendors without losing historical data
- Your AI systems have consistent data access regardless of which operational tools you use

### Action 4: Demand Multi-Tenant Architecture Visibility

Most SaaS contracts don't specify where your data lives or how it's isolated from other customers.

**New Questions to Ask:**

- Is our data logically isolated or physically isolated?
- Can you demonstrate that other customers cannot access our data?
- What is your data residency policy? (Critical for EU customers under GDPR + Data Act)
- How do you handle data export for customers with multi-regional deployments?

The Data Act strengthens your position to demand answers. Use that leverage.

## The 2025-2026 Transition Period: Strategic Timing

The Data Act enforcement begins September 12, 2025. But practical compliance will play out over 18-24 months.

**What's Happening Right Now (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026):**

**Phase 1: Vendor Announcements**

SaaS vendors are announcing compliance strategies. Some are genuine (comprehensive API improvements, MCP adoption, migration tooling). Some are performative (minimal changes, compliance theater).

**Your move:** Watch what vendors do, not what they say. Test their data export capabilities. If they're announcing compliance but haven't shipped real improvements, they're stalling.

**Phase 2: Competitive Pressure**

Vendors that ship real portability first will use it as a competitive weapon. "Unlike Competitor X, we fully support Data Act portability—try us risk-free."

**Your move:** Leverage this. When negotiating renewals, reference competitors' superior portability. Even if you're not switching, the competitive pressure works in your favor.

**Phase 3: Enforcement Examples**

The European Commission will make examples of high-profile non-compliance cases—just like they did with GDPR (Google's €50 million fine in 2019 for data portability failures).

**Your move:** If you're an EU-based company or serve EU customers, prioritize vendors with demonstrated compliance. Avoiding vendor-related regulatory risk is worth the switching cost.

**The Strategic Window (2026-2027):**

By 2027, data portability will be table stakes. The vendors that moved first will have learned what works, built better tooling, and established themselves as the "safe choice" for data-conscious buyers.

The vendors that resisted will be playing catch-up, defending their installed base, and fighting regulatory battles.

Which group do you want to build your stack on?

## Getting Started: Concrete Next Steps

**For SaaS Vendors:**

If you're running a SaaS company and you're reading this, here's the brutal truth: you're either adapting or you're dying slowly.

**30-Day Plan:**

1. **Audit your current data export capabilities** - Can a customer actually leave with full-fidelity data? Be honest.
2. **Assign a Data Act compliance owner** - This is a strategic initiative, not a legal checkbox. Make it someone with product authority.
3. **Evaluate MCP implementation** - Start with the official MCP documentation and community examples. Budget 80-160 hours for a basic implementation.
4. **Test your own export process** - Actually try to export your data and import it into a competitor. Document every friction point.

**90-Day Plan:**

5. **Ship a functional MCP server** - Even if it's limited scope initially, get something in production.
6. **Publish a Data Act compliance statement** - Proactively communicate your strategy to customers.
7. **Train customer success teams** - They need to speak fluently about data portability as a feature, not a threat.
8. **Evaluate pricing model shifts** - If you're still seat-based, model what usage-based pricing would look like.

**For SaaS Buyers:**

If you're building or managing a tech stack, this is your leverage moment.

**This Month:**

1. **Create a vendor portability scorecard** - Rank all major SaaS vendors on data portability (export formats, API quality, MCP support, migration tooling).
2. **Identify your top 3 lock-in risks** - Which vendors would be most painful to switch away from? Why?
3. **Request Data Act compliance statements** - Send a formal inquiry to each vendor asking about their compliance roadmap.

**This Quarter:**

4. **Test one vendor migration** - Pick a non-critical system and actually attempt to switch to a competitor. Document costs and friction points.
5. **Build or adopt an abstraction layer** - For critical systems, implement LangChain, custom APIs, or MCP clients that reduce direct vendor dependency.
6. **Renegotiate one contract** - Use data portability as a negotiation point. "We need guaranteed API access rates and MCP support for our next renewal."

**This Year:**

7. **Establish internal data infrastructure** - If you don't have a central data warehouse, build one. Sync SaaS data into systems you control.
8. **Shift procurement requirements** - Make data portability a first-order evaluation criterion for all new SaaS purchases.
9. **Monitor enforcement actions** - Watch how the EU enforces the Data Act. Learn from other companies' compliance failures.

## Connecting to the Bigger Picture

The Data Act isn't happening in isolation. It's part of a larger shift in how software ecosystems operate.

**Regulatory Momentum:**

- **GDPR Article 20 (2018)** established data portability rights for individuals
- **Digital Markets Act (2023)** targeted gatekeepers with interoperability requirements
- **Data Act (2025)** extends portability to business relationships and IoT
- **Seven U.S. states** passed data portability laws in 2024 alone

The trend is clear: regulators globally are breaking down data silos that vendors spent decades building.

**Technical Infrastructure:**

[Model Context Protocols](/blog/model-context-protocols) explains how MCPs provide the technical foundation for data portability at scale. The Data Act creates regulatory pressure; MCPs provide the implementation path.

**Multi-Cloud Strategy:**

[Multi-Cloud in the AI Era: Strategic Hedging or Complexity Trap?](/blog/cloud-provider-diversification) explores similar lock-in dynamics with cloud providers. The same principles apply: data portability enables negotiating leverage and reduces existential risk.

**SaaS Business Model Evolution:**

[The SAAS Reckoning: Evolution in the AI Era](/blog/saas-evolution-ai-era) covers the broader transformation of SaaS business models. Data portability is one symptom of a larger shift: from vendors competing on lock-in to vendors competing on value.

The vendors that understand these trends are connected—regulatory, technical, and business model shifts all pointing the same direction—will position themselves correctly.

The ones treating the Data Act as a compliance checkbox will be case studies in "how not to respond to structural change."

## The Bottom Line

The EU Data Act is forcing a reckoning that was inevitable anyway.

AI makes custom development increasingly viable. Organizations need data freedom to build intelligent systems. Lock-in strategies that worked for 20 years are becoming strategically disadvantageous.

The Data Act just accelerates the timeline.

**For SaaS Vendors:**

You have two choices:

**Option 1: Resist.** Implement minimal compliance, preserve lock-in where possible, hope enforcement is weak. This is a bet that your installed base is defensible and that regulatory pressure won't intensify.

**Option 2: Embrace.** Make data portability a feature, implement MCPs, shift to usage-based pricing, and compete on product quality rather than switching costs.

Option 1 is a slow bleed. Option 2 is the path to thriving in a post-lock-in world.

**For SaaS Buyers:**

You finally have leverage you haven't had in 20 years.

Use it to:
- Audit your tech stack for lock-in vulnerabilities
- Prioritize vendors that enable data freedom
- Build internal data infrastructure you control
- Renegotiate contracts with portability requirements
- Make data freedom a first-order evaluation criterion

The vendors that enable your data freedom will be your strategic partners. The ones that resist will be technical debt you're planning to remove.

**The 2025-2026 Window:**

We're in the transition period right now. The vendors making bold moves toward portability will establish themselves as the safe choice. The vendors stalling will be playing defense for years.

Your tech stack decisions in the next 18 months will compound for the next decade.

Choose vendors that believe data freedom is competitive advantage.

Because they're right.

**TLDR:** The EU Data Act (effective September 12, 2025) mandates machine-readable data export and active switching support, ending the SaaS lock-in playbook that relied on proprietary formats, rate-limited APIs, and migration friction. Documented switching costs: 3-4 weeks, $40K+ per migration. Vendors built moats on data gravity—the Data Act floods those moats. The counterintuitive truth: data freedom is competitive advantage. Customers trapped by lock-in resent vendors and seek alternatives; customers who choose to stay become advocates. MCPs (16,000+ servers, 8M+ downloads, Block case: 50-75% time savings) provide the technical infrastructure for compliance via JSON-RPC 2.0 standard protocol. Vendor strategy shifts: 67% moving to usage-based pricing (vs. seat-based), API-first architecture (not bolted-on afterthought), competing on intelligence not lock-in. Buyers should: audit tech stack for portability risk, prioritize vendors with MCP support, build internal data lakes, demand Data Act compliance statements in RFPs. The 2025-2026 transition period determines winners: vendors embracing portability gain competitive advantage, vendors resisting face enforcement risk and customer attrition. Data freedom isn't a threat—it's the new moat.
